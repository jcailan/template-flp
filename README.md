# Template for SAP Cloud Platform Portal on Cloud Foundry (SAP Fiori Launchpad)

As the title suggests, this template is intended for use in the Cloud Foundry environment of SAP Cloud Platform.
- It includes all the minimum set up required for deploying SAP Fiori Launchpad site with a Sample App configured in the launchpad.
- The template is ready for build and deploy to Cloud Foundry without any code change necessary. However, I suggest to do a **Ctrl + Find and Replace** for the word **replaceme** (in **mta.yaml**) and replace it with your preferred namespace.
